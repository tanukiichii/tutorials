Hi, I'm **Nastya Bubik**  

I'm learning **audio synthesis** and documenting everything as I go.  
This repository is basically my playground — where I experiment, build small synths and try to actually understand how sound works from the inside.

I'm not pretending to be an expert.  
I'm just building things and sharing the process.


## What's inside

This repo contains small focused projects related to sound synthesis.

You’ll find things like:

- [**Wave Generator**](./wave_synthesis /)  
- [**Additive Synthesis**](./additive_synthesis/)  
- [**Subtractive Synthesis**](./subtractive_synthesis/)  
- Other small sound experiments  

Each folder is its own mini-project with its own README explaining what’s going on.


## How to use

Each project contains a `Makefile`, so building is simple.

You can:
- read the explanations  
- run the code  
- modify parameters  
- break things (highly encouraged)

### 1. Install dependencies

You need:

- gcc
- make
- SDL2
- SDL2_ttf

## Why this exists
I believe the best way to understand synthesis is to build it from scratch:

- generate oscillators manually
- implement filters yourself
- understand what cutoff *actually* means
- see how math turns into sound

This repo grows as I learn.

If you're also into audio programming — maybe this will be useful to you too.
